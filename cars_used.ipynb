    "The project consists of an original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.\n",

    "To frame the task, throughout these practical applications we will refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM. This process provides a framework for working through a data problem. Your first step in this application will be to read through a brief overview of CRISP-DM."
